# ContactTrackingSystem
Simple contact tracking system with search and contact creation features.

# Features
* Built in Angular v14 with .NET Core 6 and C#
* Swagger integration so users can have access to the API (add `/swagger` at the end of the URL)
* SQLite and Entity Framework Core for data persistence
* Preloaded data
* Bootstrap 5

# Considerations
* In order to get the project up and running, you need to clone the repo first
* In order to run the Angular project, you will need to install NodeJS if it's not already installed in your system
* Then install the node modules: navigate to the ClientApp folder and execute `npm install` -- this will install all the Angular dependencies.
* Then run the project using Visual Studio
