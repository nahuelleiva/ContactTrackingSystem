# ContactTrackingSystem
Simple contact tracking system with search and contact creation features.

# Features
* Search feature by multiple criteria and Contact creation
* Built in Angular v14 with .NET Core 6 and C#
* Swagger integration so users can have access to the API (add `/swagger` at the end of the URL)
* SQLite and Entity Framework Core for data persistence
* Preloaded data
* Server side pagination

# Considerations
* In order to get the project up and running, you need to clone the repo first
* In order to run the Angular project, you will need to install NodeJS if it's not already installed in your system
* By running the project using Visual Studio, the system will automatically start installing the node modules for the Angular project -- this is why it is important to have NodeJS already intalled.
